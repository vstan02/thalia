## Building the project
### Prerequirements
- Java
- Clojure
- Leiningen
- YASM

These packages can usually be installed through your distributions package manager.

### Project setup
To setup the project for development, we simply have to run the `setup.sh` script:

```sh 
./setup.sh
```

### Running the program
If everything went well with the compilation we can run our compiler with `lein run`:

```
STDLIB_DIR='./stdlib/lib/' lein run './examples/example1/compile.json'
```

### Running the tests
We can run the tests with the `lein run` command:

```
lein test
```

### Installation
To install the Thalia compiler just run the `install.sh` script:
```sh 
./install.sh
```

## Usage
To compile a Thalia project you can just run:
```sh
thalia config.json
```
where the `config.json` config file contains something like this:
```json 
{
  "src": "src/",
  "dest": "bin/",
  "target": "app"
}
```

## Options
